CHUCK
(to Rebecca)
I am not crazy.
(to the Committee)
I know he swapped those numbers! I
knew it was 1216. One after Magna
Carta! As if I would make such a
mistake. Never. Never! I just,
just couldn't prove it. He made
sure of that! He covered his
tracks, got that idiot at the copy
shop to lie for him --
ALLEY

Mr. McGill, please, you don’t --!

CHUCK
(over Alley)
You think this is bad, this, this
chicanery? He's done worse! That
billboard! You’re telling me a man
just happens to fall like that? No
-- he orchestrated that! Jimmy!

ALLEY
(overlapping)
Mr. McGill, please--!

Chuck scratches at his hand, near to drawing blood he's
digging in so. The faces of the Committee start to shift.
Their outrage at Jimmy is turning to something else...

CHUCK

He defecated through a sun roof! I
saved him, but I shouldn't have.
Took him into my own firm! What
was I thinking!?

He appeals to everyone and no one. Looking at Rebecca,
Alley, Hamlin, Kim. Their faces all filling with that
loathsome, awful pity.
CHUCK

He’ll never change. Since he was
nine, always the same! Couldn’t
keep his hands out of the cash
drawer. But no, not Jimmy! It
couldn’t be precious Jimmy!
Stealing them blind! And him a
lawyer. What a sick joke.

He looks to the Committee. They’ve got to be on his side,
right..?

CHUCK

I should have stopped him when I
had a chance. You, you have to
stop him! You have to --!!

The room’s dead silent. Here is the Chuck Jimmy described:
a sad case who can’t hold it together in the presence of a
tiny battery. A man unglued and unwell.
Chuck looks around. Taking a breath. Understanding at last
that he has lost. Too late, he composes himself.

CHUCK

I apologize. I... lost my train of
thought. Got... carried away.

(diminished, to Jimmy)
Do... do you have anything else?

Jimmy looks at his brother. The man he just buried.

JIMMY
(evenly)
No. Nothing further.

Jimmy takes his seat, still watching Chuck. Kim looks at
Jimmy, overwhelmed by the enormity of what she and Jimmy just
did.
Chuck sinks down in his chair, spent. He stares at that damn
EXIT sign. Still glowing.
The tiny HUM of it rises, slightly. Off this tableau, we...
